# Bayes Theorem (GATE DA)

Bayes' theorem relates conditional probabilities:

**Formula:**
P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)

where P(B) > 0.

**Example:**
Suppose a box has 2 red and 3 blue balls. Draw one ball at random.
Let A be the event "ball is red", B be the event "ball is from this box".
(This is a toy example; in practice define events carefully.)

**Common mistakes:**
- Forgetting to normalize by P(B)
- Confusing P(A|B) and P(B|A)
